  The knit design concept ‘Human body 2.0’ was created for the knit design contest ‘Feel the Yarn’ directed by the CPF (Consorzio Promozione Filati) and Pitti Immagine. The challenge was to create two knitwear outfits in line with the topic ‘knit mix’. The design was presented at the Pitti Filati fair in Florence in June 2017. The yarn was sponsored by Manifattura Sesia s.r.l.

*The design of the outfit is inspired by ‘transhumanism’ and ‘human enhancement’. Both deal with the idea to redesign and optimize a human being by using different substances and technologies – resulting in the ‘Cyborg’, the complete merger of human being and machine. This is the chance for audacity – the chance for a fair world that allows diverse life plans independent of physicality. Terms like generation, gender, or race melt. Opening to subversive solutions, the human being can constantly redefine ‚itself‘ through technical updates.*

*Following these ideas, the outfits should be understood as unexpected voluminous but genuine fashion bodies that are not subject to any gender-specific codes but rather its materiality; a materiality being determined by the high-contrast mixture of yarns and by knitted pattern as elementary components of the knit design. 
Technical details in the fashion bodies allow the person wearing it to obtain extended sensory abilities facilitating the interaction with the surrounding in an innovative manner.*
